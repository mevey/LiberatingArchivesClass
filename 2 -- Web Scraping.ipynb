    "### Learning goals\n",
    "In this section, we will learn how to program a computer to do what many of us have done plenty of times before: download files from the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries and archives around the world are going digital, making it possible for anyone with an internet connection to search through their holdings, find interesting documents, download them, and read them on their computer. Growing digitization increases our access to the world's knowledge at a rapid clip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a researcher who is searching not just for the contents of one particular document, but who wants to enlist the help of a computer to read thousands of documents at once. With today's text analysis tools, researchers can uncover patterns of human behavior across all those documents by pulling them together in one place where a computer can read them all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is: we already know how to find and download documents from the internet. Most of us do it at least a few times a week. We go to a website, scroll to a link, click, scroll to another link, click, and then click on a 'file download' button. The file appears at the bottom of our browser window, we double-click it, and it pops up into a window as a PDF, as a Microsoft Word file, or as a text file. No problem! \n",
    "\n",
    "The bad news is: it takes us about 20-30 seconds of pointing and clicking to download a single file ... and we want to download thousands of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is more good news: with today's freely available technology, it is rather easy to program a computer to do all of this pointing and clicking for us. And that is precisely what you will learn in this section! You will teach your computer to literally take over your web browser and navigate through the site as you would navigate it yourself - just at greater speed and with greater persistence. This is a task generally known as \"web scraping\" where you collect text or files from a webpage and store them on your hard drive. \n"
